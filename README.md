# MXXX-project-template
This is a standardized repo template for jelinski lab new project repos which follows our lab-specific open science guide procedures [insert link here to guide]. 

## Registering a unique project ID on @jelinski-lab-project-registry
When using this template to set up a new project repo, please first obtain a new project ID by adding your project as a new row to [@jelinski-lab-project-registry]. Simply add a row with the next number in sequence (i.e. if the last registered project is M059-jelinski-permafrost-table-id, then your project should be M060-xxxxx) followed by your last name (assuming you are the project lead/owner) and then a 2-4 word descriptive title for your project (note - spend at least a bit of time thinking about this as this is what will be used on all other platforms (your personal computer, GitHub, GoogleDrive, etc...) as your project name.

## Cloning the template to your personal GitHub page
Assuming that you are the project lead/owner, the first step is to clone this template to your personal GitHub page and set it as private initially. Any manuscripts/proposals in development (i.e. not published or awarded) should be set as private by default. Once manuscripts are in press or published then you can flip the repo to public.

## Rename the template repo 
Now, rename the template repo using your registered project ID.

## Default repo directory and subdirectory structure
Use the default standardized folder structure unless there is an explicit reason to do something different!
